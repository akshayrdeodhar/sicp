An expression consists of:
Numbers
Symbols (+ and SOS are both symbols)

Lambdas          |
Conditionals     | later
Definitions      |

Combinations

Evalulate (expression)
	Evaluate character to get procedures
	Evaluate operands to get arguements
	Apply:
	Substitute actual arguements for parameter in definintion
	Evalulate sub-procedures

The Shape of the Algorithm

Two ways of peano addition

(define (+ a b)
 (if (= a 0)
  b
  (+ (dec a) (inc b)))) 

Here
(+ 3 4) |
(+ 2 5) | time
(+ 1 6) | 
(+ 0 7) |

______
space

time = O(a)
space = O(1)

Iteration
_________________________________________________-

(define (+ a b)
 (if (= a 0)
  b
  (inc (+ (dec a) b))))

Here

(+ 3 4)                   |
(inc (+ (dec 2) 4))       | 
(inc (inc (+ (dec 1) 4))) |
(inc (inc (inc (+ 0 4)))) | time
(inc (inc (inc 4)))       |
(inc (inc 5))             |
(inc (6))                 |
7

______________
    space 
   (ignore the constant after)

time = O(a)
space = O(b)

Linear Recursion
______________________________________________


So what is the difference between iteration and recursion?
Both the peano arithmetic functions have recursive definitions- each is
defined in terms of itself

So what is it in the upper process that makes it an iteration?

Two ways to think about this:

a. In recursion, there is bureucracy- you have more people who are waiting for
a 'chit'. In linear, there is less beurocracy- no chits outstaning- the final
chit is given back to the original person

b. In iteration, the current state of the function (parameters) is sufficient
to find the answer. In recursion, there is stuff under the table- stuff with
the computer-> the (inc (inc (inc which will not be saved. So the function
call is not sufficient to resume execution

So all those 'recursive' function answers that don't 'feel' clever are not
recursive after all

An easy way to reduce space in recursion is to create an array of n answers
and store answers there- then you can look up on the array to find any answer
you have already written

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A recursive procedure is different from a recursive procedure-
In fact, both the procedures above are recursive- they are defined in terms of
themselves.
However, the processess they generate need not be recursive

Another way to look at iteration:
A finite set of state variables, and a way to get to the next state of the
variables.
A way to look at iteration- a chain of defered operators, whose number and
config determines the next state. The state variables themselves are not
sufficient to get to the answer
