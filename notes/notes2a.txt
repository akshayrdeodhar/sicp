What diffrentiates LISP from other languages:

--> Recursion:
If I can directly solve a problem, do it
Otherwise, solve a smaller problem and do something to the result

There is something wrong with writing the same code again

The only difference between the procedures for adding integers in sequence and
squares of integers in sequence is having (+ a ..) in one and (+ (SQR a) ...)
in other.

Any time we have a bunch of things that are identical, we should come up with
an abstraction to cover them

All arguements to a procedure have the same level of indentation.

An abstraction can represent an 'idea'. We can name that idea, and use it
again and again

(DEFINE (SIGMA TERM A NEXT B)	
	(IF (> A B)
		0
		(SIGMA TERM
		       (NEXT A)
		       NEXT
                       B)))	

Now, SQUARE-SUM becomes

(DEFINE (SQUARE-SUM A B)
	(SIGMA SQR A +1 B)) !!

But, INT-SUM requires an IDENTITY procedure! (to pass as arguement for
parameter TERM)
(DEFINE (IDENTITY A) A)

Here, I was forced to write a named procedure (IDENTITY A) to pass as
arguement
But there is a better way- 
LAMBDAS:
Lambdas are anonymous functions, which are used only once (precisely because
we do not 'remember' them)
Now, IDENTITY can be replaced by (LAMBDA (i) i)
The term in the pi-sum (1 / (i * (i + 2))) can be replaced by
(LAMBDA (i) (/ 1 (* i (+ i 2))))!

(Abhijit Rocks)
This allows us to change the method of addition (say from recursive to
iterative) without changing everything. I simply make SIGMA iterative, rather
than changing all of INT-SUM, SQR-SUM and PI-SUM

Procedures are not special. Procedure names are also variables, whose value is
a procedure.
They can be passed as arguements from one procedure to another

(NEXT A) is "applying NEXT to A (evaluating to the next value of A)"
NEXT is "the procedure NEXT"

(DEFINE AVERAGE-DAMP .. define AVERAGE-DAMP 
 (LAMBDA (F)         .. as the procedure LAMBDA which takes an arguement F
	 (LAMBDA (X) (AVERAGE X (F X))))) .. which is a PROCEDURE taking an arguement X and returns the average of F and F(X)

Alternatively this can be done as
(DEFINE (AVERAGE-DAMP F)
 (DEFINE (FOO X) defineFOO as a procedure having arguement X
  (AVERAGE X (F X)))    which returns the average of X and (F X)
 FOO) and returns the procedure FOO

AVERAGE-DAMP takes a single arguement F
It is the procedure which it returns which takes a single arguement X!

Higher Order Procedures are procedures that take procedural arguements and
return procedures as values
Now these can be used as a means of abstraction

(DEFINE (FIXED-POINT F INITIAL)
 (DEFINE (ITER OLD NEW)
  (IF (CLOSE-ENOUGH OLD NEW)
      NEW
      (ITER (NEW (F NEW))))) 
 (ITER INITIAL (F INITIAL)))

Why average-damp?
Consider this- for square root of X, fixed point of X/Y is also SQRT(X)!
Why not find fixed point of this, instead of (Y + X/Y) / 2?
Reapplying F = X/Y keeps the value oscillating about the answer
Averaging brings value closer to the actual value, reduces the amplitude of
the oscillation so to speak

Building Newton't Method:

yn+1 = yn - f(yn) / f'(yn)
yn+1(yn) = yn --> fixed point
i.e when yn is sufficiently close to yn+1, we have our answer

When I put y s.t y = 0 in this, yn+1 = yn
Fixed point will give us 0

Now, 
sqrt(x) is that y s.t y^2 = x
What we want is a zero of the function
f(y) = x - y^2

so

(define (sqrt x) sqrt as
 (newton (lambda(y) (- x (sqr y))) guess)) the the root returned by the
newton'w method applied to the function x - y^2 starting with initial guess
'guess'

But I do not have newton yet
Fear not. Newton is nothing but the procedure which finds the fixed point of
the function defined as F(y) = y - f(y) / f'(y)

(define (newton f guess)
 (define df (deriv f))
 (fixed-point (lambda(y) (- y (/ (f y) (df y)))) guess))

But where is the derivative?
Derivative is a procedure which takes a procedure which computes a function as
arguement and returns a procedure which computes it's derivative

(define (deriv f)
 (lambda(x) (/ (- (f (+ x dx)) (f x)) dx)))

OR

(define deriv .. define derivative
 (lambda(f) .. as that lambda function of f
  (lambdd(x) (/ (- (f (+ x dx)) (f x)) dx)))) -- which returns the lambda
function which computes the derivative of f

(define dx 0.000001)

-> Functions as first class citizens

1. Should be able to have names-> C has this
2. To be passed as arguements to procedures-> C has this somewhat, using
function pointers
3. To be returned as result of procedure -> C does not have this
4. To be incorporated into data structures -> C has this in the form of
function pointers

-> From the book:

Lambdas can be defined and CALLED at the same time
eg.
We used a lambda to define an incrementor to be passed to sum as 'next'
However, we can also define and use a lambda thus:

((lambda(x y z) (- (+ x y) z)) 1 3 2)
and get value 2
here, The definition of lambda takes the place of the operand
Here, if we use some 'x' from the outer scope as a parameter to the lambda
expression, it will be different from the 'x' in the definition of lambda

This can be used to create an equivalent of assignment inside a procedure:
((lambda(a b c) (expression of a, b c)) <var 1> <var 2> <var 3>)
This is like assigning vars to a, b, c and then using a, b, c in an expression

'let' is used as syntactic sugar for such use:
(let ((a <var 1>)
      (b <var 2>)
      (c <var 3>))
      (expression of a, b, c))

So 
(let ((var1 exp1)
      (var2 exp2)
      .
      .
      .
      (varn expn))
      body)

is equivalent to

((lambda(var1 var2 ... varn)
        body)
  exp1
  exp2
  .
  .
  .
  expn)

Now, exp1, exp2 are computed outside the scope of the lambda, and thus the
let, too

-> Abstraction:

Both methods of computing square root, and newton's method are methods which
find fixed points of the transform of some function.
The Diophantes method finds the fixed point of the average-damp (transform) of
y-> x / y (function)
The Newton's method finds the fixed point of the newton's transform of the
function y -> y^2 - x
This can be generalised as s procedure

(define (fixed-point-of-transform f transform guess) define as that procedure
 (fixed-point (transform f) guess)) which finds fixed point of transform of f,
with initial guess 'guess'!

This brings much more clarity than a big definition with many internal
definition. This furthers our goal of holding more information in the mind at
the same time, ignoring what's below
